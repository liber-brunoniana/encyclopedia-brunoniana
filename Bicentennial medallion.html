<article><p>The <b>Bicentennial Medallion</b> was presented at the Bicentennial Alumni <a href="Convocation.html">Convocation</a> on February 6, 1965 by <a href="President.html">President</a> Keeney to 24 illustrious graduates and <a href="President.html">President</a> Emeritus Henry M. Wriston. The medallion was designed by Richard Lippold, its theme expressed by a latticed circlet of interlocking bronze V’s about an orb of polished gold. The V, interpreted as the Roman U, stands for “University.” Taken together, the twenty overlapping V’s form twenty Roman X’s, which represent the 200 years of Brown. The Latin inscription on the gold center is “Honos Honorem Parit” translated, “In honoring you, we are honored.” The medallion, three inches in diameter, rests in a case made of wood from old tables in the John Hay <a href="Library.html">Library</a>. In addition to the 26 medallions conferred, one has been placed in the University Archives and one in the Museum of Modern <a href="Art.html">Art</a>.
