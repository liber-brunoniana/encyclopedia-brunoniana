<p>The <b>Mission</b> of the University is embodied in the Charter:</p><blockquote>“Whereas Institutions for liberal Education are highly beneficial to Society by forming the rising Generation to Virtue Knowledge and usefull Literature, and thus preserving in the Community a Succession of Men duly qualified for discharging the offices of Life with Usefullness and Reputation They have always merited and receivd the Publick Attention & Encouragement of every wise Polite and well regulated State ...”</blockquote>The University’s <i>Self-study Report for the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges</i> in 1988 added, “Because of the vintage of these words and their obvious good sense, there has been no perceived need, since 1764, to supersede them with a more elaborate, formal statement of missions and objectives. If such a formal mission statement were to be adopted today it might look something like:<blockquote>‘Brown is a University-College. It has as its objective the offering of educational programs of the highest quality for undergraduates interested in the liberal arts and sciences and engineering, professional training for students pursuing a career in medicine, and graduate education and training in the arts and sciences, engineering and medicine. Its faculty is devoted to instruction and research and is expected to teach both undergraduate and graduate students. The goal of Brown, its faculty and staff, is to carry out these objectives at the highest level of excellence. Brown seeks to be the best University-College.’”</blockquote>
