<p> The <b>Association of Class Officers</b> began as the Association of Class Secretaries in 1902, when the Brown Alumni Monthly, scarcely two years old, gave a dinner at the University Club for the secretaries of the classes from 1857 to 1902, hoping to encourage subscriptions to the <i>Monthly,</i> and to organize the secretaries to work for the interests of the University. The Association of Class Secretaries was duly formed and elected George L. Miner 1897 its first secretary. The Association helped to start <a href="Homecoming.html">Homecoming</a> weekend and <a href="Alumni Field Day.html">Alumni Field Day</a>. A few years after the merger of Brown and Pembroke, the Association included Pembroke secretaries. The next admitted to membership were the class presidents, and by 1977, after the vice-presidents and treasurers of the classes were admitted, the group became the Association of Class Officers.</p>
