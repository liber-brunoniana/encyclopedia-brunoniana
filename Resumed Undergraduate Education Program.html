<p>The <b>Resumed Undergraduate <a href="Education.html">Education</a> Program</b> began in 1973, having been approved by the faculty in the fall of 1972 as an experimental six-year program to enroll students who had been away from formal study for at least five years and were at least 25 years old. Charlotte Lowney Tomas â€™57 was associate dean for resumed education. Some resumed education students had earlier college education and some had not studied beyond high school, and their number was restricted to two per cent of the total enrollment. After its experimental period the successful program gained official and permanent status.</p>
