<p>The Dean of the University was an office established by the Advisory and Executive Committee in December 1899 to relieve the president of routine and disciplinary work. The first dean was Winslow Upton, who resigned in 1901 for health reasons. Alexander Meiklejohn was dean from 1901 to 1912, and concerned himself with scholastic achievement, attendance, athletic activities, and social life of the students. Otis Randall, who followed Meiklejohn, was dean until 1930. He wrote a book, <i>The Dean’s Window,</i> about his experiences and observations as dean. After a year as acting dean in 1929-1930, Samuel T. Arnold was given the title of Dean of Undergraduates. In 1937 his title was changed to Dean of the College. There was no Dean of the University until 1946, when Arnold assumed that office. Robert W. Kenny was Dean of the College from 1947 to 1952. In 1949 Arnold was named <a href="Provost.html">Provost</a> and there was no Dean of the University.</p><p>In the 1950s and 60s the deanery at Brown became known as a training ground for college presidents. The five Deans of the College who became college presidents were: James Stacy Coles, acting dean of the College for one year when he became president of Bowdoin College in 1952; Brown president Barnaby Keeney, acting dean in 1952-53 and dean from 1953 to 1955; K. Roald Bergethon, acting dean in 1955-56 and dean from 1956 to 1958, who went to Lafayette College; Charles H. Watts II ’47, dean from 1958 to 1962, who became president of Bucknell; and Robert W. Morse, dean from 1962 to 1964, who became president of Case Western Reserve University.</p><p>In 1964 the <a href="Corporation.html">Corporation</a> created the post of Dean of the University again and Merton P. Stoltz was named to the office. <a href="President.html">President</a> Keeney explained that “Dean Stoltz will work with me on those aspects of the University that relate directly to education and the substance of research. ... The intention is not to interpose Dean Stoltz between the <a href="President.html">President</a> and the Deans and the <a href="Faculty.html">Faculty</a>, but to juxtapose him beside the <a href="President.html">President</a> in order to extend the competence of that office.”</p><p>In 1965 at a junior convocation <a href="President.html">President</a> Barnaby Keeney in a speech on campus communication had occasion to discuss the function of deans. The occasion was an appeal to the <a href="Corporation.html">Corporation</a>, charging “lack of communication,” by students who were dissatisfied with the response of the president and deans to their campaign to have parietal rules liberalized. Keeney said, “the business of the Deans is to form and administer the rules for activities, the curriculum, and other matters of business relating to the students. I see the Deans quite frequently, some of them every day. They tell me what they have in mind, and they usually tell me what other people have in mind.... the Deans, in effect, stand between the <a href="President.html">President</a> and the students. Generally speaking, the Deans are apt to have a more liberal point of view than the <a href="President.html">President</a>, if only because they are likely to be younger, and to sympathize more with students, if only because they are more thoroughly involved with them. ... Be kind to your Deans; they are good Deans, and there is a lot of good wear left in them. Do not attempt to undermine their position between you and the <a href="President.html">President</a>, but rather sympathize with them, for both of the layers between which they are ground can be very nasty indeed.”</p><p>Robert O. Schulze was the Dean of the College from 1964 to 1968, followed by F. Donald Eckelmann from 1968 to 1971. The position of Dean of the College was reestablished in 1974 with Thomas F.
