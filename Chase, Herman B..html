<p>Herman Burleigh Chase (1913-1984), professor of biology, was born in New Hampton, New Hampshire, on May 7, 1913. He graduated from the New Hampton School in 1930 and from Dartmouth College in 1934. He earned his Ph.D. degree at the University of Chicago in 1938.

Brown Professor of Biology in 1960.
