<p>The <b>Pembroke Alumna</b> was the alumnae magazine of Pembroke College, which superseded an earlier publication called the <i>Brown Alumnae News Letter.</i> The <i>News Letter</i> had made its first appearance in 1928, the year in which the name of the Women’s College was changed to Pembroke College. The first issue, a mimeographed offering of five pages, announced, “This news letter, bulletin, embryonic magazine, what you will, is in the nature of an experiment that we hope will work, a venture that we intend to make permanent.” In its second year, in March 1929, the <i>Brown Alumnae News Letter,</i> “Published by the Alumnae Association of Brown University,” became a printed leaflet of four pages. It continued in this format, growing over the years to eight pages, and from 1932 including occasional photographs. The issue for February 1950 was a magazine with a photographic cover and a newly acquired title, <i>Pembroke News Letter.</i> The title was occasionally <i>Pembroke News Letter and Alumnae Record,</i> when the honor roll of donors was included. The <i>News Letter</i> was edited by Gertrude Allen McConnell ’10 until her retirement in 1955, and then by Doris Hopkins Stapelton ’28 until 1957. The change of title to <i>Pembroke Alumna</i> took place in October 1957. Editors of the <i>Pembroke Alumna</i> were Polly Welts Kaufman ’51 from October 1957 to January 1968, Sally Kappelman Riggs ’62 from April 1968 to July 1971, after which the <i>Pembroke Alumna</i> merged with the <i>Brown Alumni Monthly.</i></p>
