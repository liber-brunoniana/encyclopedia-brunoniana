<article><p><b>BTV,</b> Brown’s student-run television station, was founded by two undergraduates, Douglas Liman ’88 and David Bartis ’88. In their senior year Liman and Bartis conceived the idea of a nationwide association of college television stations, and in July 1988, with the assistance of Brown’s Development Office, they were able to receive a three-year grant of $300,000 from CBS to start the National Association of College Broadcasters with headquarters at Brown. In November 1988 NCAB held its first national conference at Brown with Walter Cronkhite as keynote speaker. Subsequent conferences have featured Ted Turner ’60, Morley Safer of “60 Minutes” and Robert Pittman of MTV in 1989. NCAB also publishes an association magazine and runs a satellite network, U-Net, which broadcasts student-produced shows submitted by college stations.</p></article>
