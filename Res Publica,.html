<p><i>Res Publica,</i> subtitled “a journal of public opinion,” was a Brown political journal which was started in March 1966 by a group of undergraduates, and published by Liber Brunensis Publications. Its first editors were Ira Magaziner ’69 and Lawrence Gottlieb ’69. Featuring articles of political interest by faculty members, students, and national figures, <i>Res Publica</i> announced that it “takes no editorial position, but exists as a forum for political opinion.” Publication ceased in June 1970.</p>
