<article><p>The <b><i>Brunavian</i></b> began as a mimeographed publication of the U.S. Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps in November 1940. A memorandum from the professor of naval science and tactics greeted the first NROTC unit to be established at Brown, noting that its members were “embarking on a four years’ cruise with us and the U.S. Navy,” which he hoped would be a “pleasant and profitable experience.” The <i>Brunavian</i> contained news of the unit, messages from the Captain, accounts of football games, rifle team matches, and other extracurricula activities, and cartoons of navy life. The first issue of the “new series” of a printed <i>Brunavian</i> with photographs in October 1943 announced that the magazine was designed to keep the men informed, to develop “esprit de corps” and to generally serve a “happy crew.” In this issue and in later ones at appropriate times appeared photographs of the men who were leaving Brown either as graduated ensigns or transferred V-12s with yearbook-style information about their activities. The magazine also provided news of men who had left, news of the unit at Brown, some candid photographs, cartoons and jokes, and a regular feature, a photograph of the current “Pembroke Pin-up” girl. Publication continued until 1945. In 1948/49 a mimeographed newspaper of the Naval ROTC Unit called <i>Fairway</i> was issued. The next year the title of <i>Brunavian</i> was resumed, and as such it continued until 1953. One more revival of the <i>Brunavian</i> was attempted and at least two issues appeared in November and December of 1955.</p></article>
