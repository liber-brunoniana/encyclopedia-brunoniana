<p>Merton Philip Stoltz (1913-1989), provost and acting president of Brown University, was born in Glidden, Wisconsin, on March 28, 1913. He graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1934 and earned a master’s degree at Brown in 1936. After earning his Ph.D. at Minnesota in 1941, he returned to Brown as assistant professor of economics. He was named full professor in 1950. He was chairman of the Department of Economics from 1956 to 1964, associate dean of the Graduate School from 1960 to 1964, and dean of the University from 1964 to 1966. As dean he was actively involved in proposals to the Ford Foundation and in the beginnings of the medical education program. One of the first acts of President Heffner on his arrival was to appoint Stoltz provost of the University, a post which had been vacant since June of 1965. In announcing the appointment Heffner said of his choice, “His integrity, his vision, his sensitivity to Brown traditions, and his demonstrated capacity for leadership make him ideally qualified for the position of principal academic office of this great University.” He was three times acting president of Brown, serving in 1969-70 between the presidencies of Heffner and Hornig, in the summer of 1972 while President Hornig recovered from a heart attack, and in 1976 between the presidencies of Hornig and Swearer. He retired in 1978. As an economist Stoltz was chosen to head the Special Providence Committee on Municipal Revenue in 1957 and served on the Rhode Island Fiscal Study Commission in 1961. Tougaloo College awarded him an honorary LL.D. degree in 1977, and at Brown’s Commencement that year he received a standing ovation on the announcement by President Swearer of the establishment of the Merton P. Stoltz Professorship. Brown awarded him an honorary LL.D. degree in 1978. He died on August 7, 1989 in Providence.</p>
