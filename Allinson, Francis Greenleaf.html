His best known publications were his edition of Menander in the Loeb Classical Library and “Lucian” in the series, <i>Our Debt to Greece and Rome.</i> Professor Allinson retired from active teaching in 1928 and died June 23, 1931 at Hancock Point, Maine.</p><p>The Faculty Resolution on his death stated, “Professor Allinson combined the highest degree of erudition with the simplest modesty. Connoisseur of literature both ancient and modern, discriminating critic, stimulating teacher, he scorned pretentiousness, inaccuracy, and sham, but gave the quickest and warmest of generous recognition to merit. He taught his students to form definite opinions. Punctilious in the highest degree, he was the soul of courtesy, and when justice compelled him to be severe, the sparkle of his wit tempered his rebuke.” President Faunce said of him, “He was endowed with ‘an intellectual delicacy unsurpassed by any Greek scholar in America.’ ”</p>
