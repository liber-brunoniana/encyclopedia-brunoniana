<article><p><b>Plantations House</b> was opened in the fall of 1954 as a dormitory center for commuting students. The University renovated the former Lambda Chi Alpha house at 32 George Street, furnishing a lounge and study rooms on the first floor and dormitory accommodations on the upper floor. The concept of Plantations House was to give commuters a place to meet and study during the day and a place to stay overnight after evening functions. The students built party rooms in the basement, fielded intramural teams, and invited faculty guests to Wednesday night discussions. In the fall of 1962 Plantations House was assigned to the house at 20 Benevolent Street, and was later located at 219 Bowen Street from about 1970 until the early 1980s, when there was no further need for a day center for commuters.</p></article>
