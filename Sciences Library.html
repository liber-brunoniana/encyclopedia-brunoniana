<p>The <b>Sciences Library</b> opened in December 1971 after 31 months of construction beset by many delays. It replaced the Biological Sciences Library which had been housed in the Arnold Laboratory, and the Physical Sciences Library which had been located in Metcalf Research Laboratory and then temporarily in the John Hay Library. The new library, fourteen stories of poured concrete, has a capacity of 450,000 volumes along with 303 carrels and over 30 faculty studies and conference rooms. Warner, Burns, Toan and Lunde were the architects and Dimeo Construction Company was the contractor.</p>
