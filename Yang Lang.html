<article><p><b><i>Yang Lang,</i></b> subtitled “an illustrated journal devoted to burlesque and light literature” came out in March 1869 in a four-page newspaper format, announcing that it would be published monthly by the students of Brown University during the academic year. The second issue had eight pages and a two-page supplement, and succeeding numbers grew to twelve pages. The literature was, as promised, light. There were a few jokes and “exchanges” of news from other colleges and, beginning with the second issue, two or more pages of advertisements. The final issue appeared in January 1870.</p></article>
