<p><b>Pi Kappa,</b> was a junior society, said to be “reinstituted in 1900.” In the <i><a href="Liber Brunensis.html">Liber Brunensis</a>,</i> beginning in 1901, the list of members of Pi Kappa appears, under this heading, “1864-1894 Re-Instituted 1900.” Whether Pi Kappa existed at an earlier date is uncertain. The <i><a href="Brown Paper.html">Brown Paper</a></i> includes in November 1864 and again in November 1865 a society called “Pi Kappa Fraternitas,” with a list of members whose names are decidedly fictitious. The revived society, if such it was, presented during <a href="Junior Week.html">Junior Week</a> in April 1901 a farce entitled “Through Thick and Thin” in Lyman Gymnasium, which the <i>Brown Daily Herald</i> described as “not at all pretentious in plot or length,” but “bright and witty.” The annual farce became a tradition of Pi Kappa, which also assumed the function of host to visiting athletic teams. New members were traditionally announced at the junior prom in a ceremony at midnight in which they were “tapped” by the outgoing members. When Pi Kappa was replaced by the <a href="Brown Key.html">Brown Key</a> in 1930, the retiring members tapped the new Key members.</p>
