<p>The Institute for International Studies was established in September 1986. The inspiration for the Institute came from Thomas J. Watson, Jr. ’37, and began with an invitation he issued to <a href="President.html">President</a> Howard Swearer to come to Moscow where Watson was ambassador to the Soviet Union to discuss Watson’s thoughts on international, particularly Soviet-American, relations and the arms control issue. Watson felt that the greatest hope for the future of international relations was the education of young people. Swearer announced the preliminary plans for the Institute at the 1985 Opening <a href="Convocation.html">Convocation</a>.
