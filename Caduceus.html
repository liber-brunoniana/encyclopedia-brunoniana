<p>The <b>Caduceus</b> was the publication of Gamma Nu, a non-secret society. It was first published in December 1865 as an alternative to the <i>Brown Paper,</i> which was the annual publication of the secret societies. Its first page listed the faculty, the members of Phi Beta Kappa, Gamma Nu and the “Oudens,” a group of non-society men, along with the literary societies, the Philermenian Society and the United Brothers. After a lapse of three years, another issue of the <i>Caduceus</i> appeared in December 1868. In the meantime, the Philermenian and United Brothers societies had ceased to exist, and Gamma Nu had become a chapter of Delta Upsilon, a non-secret fraternity. In 1870 the <i>Caduceus</i> appeared in magazine form with a literary department added. The issue of 1871 and the final issue in 1872 were published by Delta Upsilon and Wayland Literary Societies.</p>
