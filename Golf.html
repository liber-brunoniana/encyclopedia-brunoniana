<p><b>Golf</b> became accessible to Brown students in October 1901, when a change in the constitution of the Metacomet Club in East Providence provided that members of the newly formed Brown Golf Club would be admitted to the Metacomet Club without further recommendation. This was accomplished through the interest of Brown faculty members who belonged to the Metacomet Club. Professor Albert K. Potter was elected the first president of the Brown Golf Club. In 1903 Brown won the New England intercollegiate golf tournament at the Wannamoisett Club, defeating Amherst and M.I.T. Golf became a recognized sport in 1920, and over the years had a few highly successful seasons, which occurred in 1931, 1941, 1949, 1955, 1956, 1968, 1971, 1972, and 1975. The 1969 and 1975 teams were undefeated.</p><p>While Brown has educated some prominent golfers, they have often pursued their golf careers independently rather than as members of Brown’s golf teams. Roland Mackenzie ’29, an accomplished golfer before he came to Brown, was named to the U.S. Walker Cup team as a freshman. After taking time off from college and improving his strength by working as a lumberjack, he returned to play with the 1928 team and finish second in the Intercollegiate tournament that year. Jean Bauer ’33, whose college sports were basketball, baseball, field hockey, swimming, archery, fistball, and bowling, won three Rhode Island golf championships and competed twice in the Women’s Nationals.</p><p>In its best season in seven years the golf team in 1982 finished fourth in the <a href="Ivy League.html">Ivy League</a> and fourth of twelve teams in the New England Championships. The next season’s record was 6-5, and the team finished fourth in the <a href="Ivy League.html">Ivy League</a> and seventh of fifteen in the New England tournament. Funding for golf as a varsity sport was withdrawn in 1991 as part of the University’s budget reduction. Among the golf coaches have been Frank S. Souchak from 1942 to 1943, Charles A. Engle in 1943 and again from 1947 to 1950, Ralph Anderton from 1951 to 1961, L. Stanley Ward from 1961 to 1963, J. Allen Soares from 1963 to 1970, Mike Koval in 1970-71, Jack Ferreira in 1971-71, Richard L. Toomey from 1972 to 1979, Jay Riley from 1979 to 1982, Paul Butler from 1982 to 1988, and Chris Humm, whose four-year record since 1988 is 24-16.</p>
