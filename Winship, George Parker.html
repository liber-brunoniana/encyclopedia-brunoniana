He was employed in 1895 to catalogue and take charge of the private library of John Carter Brown 1816. When the library was given to Brown University in 1904 and the John Carter Brown Library built to house it, Winship came along and remained as librarian until 1915. At that time he became the librarian of the Widener Library, which had been given to Harvard as a memorial by the mother of Harry Elkins Widener, a book collector, who was lost when the Titanic sank in 1912.
