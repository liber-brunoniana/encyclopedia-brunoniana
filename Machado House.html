<article><p><b>Machado House</b> at 87 Prospect Street was formerly the Ellen Dexter Sharpe House, a two-and-one-half story brick Elizabethan Revival house designed by Parker, Thomas and Rice, and built as the Sharpe family home in 1912. The house, property of the <a href="Rhode Island School of Design.html">Rhode Island School of Design</a> after Miss Sharpeâ€™s death in 1953, was purchased by Brown in 1955 and used as a small dormitory for women students. An extension at the rear of the building was designed by Steven L. Lerner and added in 1975. At a ceremony on November 10, 1989 the building was formally renamed Antonio Machado House in honor of the Spanish poet. A bust of Machado by sculptor Pablo Serrano acquired by the University in 1967 was moved from the <a href="Annmary Brown Memorial.html">Annmary Brown Memorial</a> to the garden of the house.</p></article>
