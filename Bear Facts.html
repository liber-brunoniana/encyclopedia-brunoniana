The first such handbook was called <i>Student’s Hand-Book of Brown University</i> and was published by the Young Men’s Christian Association in 1888. The earliest issues were devoted exclusively to religious information, such as the work of the Y.M.C.A., a schedule of prayer meetings, a brief history of the missionary movement at Brown, and a directory of Protestant churches in Providence. In 1891 additional information was included, such as banks, telegraph offices, and the location of over 200 fire alarm boxes in the city. In 1892 Brown University buildings, points of interest in Providence, and a catalogue of the portraits in <a href="Sayles Hall.html">Sayles Hall</a> were added. The handbook grew to include helpful hints for new students, songs, and information about student organizations and athletics.
