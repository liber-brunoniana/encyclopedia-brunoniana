<p>The <b>Bicentennial celebration</b> began on March 2, 1964, with a formal convocation in Sayles Hall at noon, with John Nicholas Brown as the principal speaker, after which the American flag was lowered and hoisted again with the Bicentennial Flag of the University flying below. The new flag, bearing the bicentennial emblem, the Colonial seal together with the present seal, had been sewn by a Pembroke senior, Shirley Morrison. Then several University delegates traveled to East Greenwich, where the Charter had been granted on March 2, 1764, to present a plaque to the Old Colony House in commemoration of this event. The celebration of the bicentennial year included a variety of events between September 1964 and June 1965. On Wednesday, September 2, 1964 the annual meeting of the Corporation was held in the Colony House in Newport where the first Corporation met for the first time on the first Wednesday in September 1764, when 24 of the original incorporators took the oath of office. Governor John H. Chafee brought the greetings of the State of Rhode Island and officially proclaimed the opening of Brown’s Bicentennial Year. A commemorative plaque inscribed “In this building on September 5, 1764 was held the first meeting of the Corporation of ’the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island,’ now Brown University” was unveiled and installed in the Colony House. Another plaque was placed on John Gardner’s house, now the Old Colony - Newport National Bank, at 8 Washington Square, to commemorate James Manning’s meeting with Rhode Island residents to discuss the design of the Baptists to found a college in the colony. Professor Carl Bridenbaugh delivered an historical address on the University’s beginnings and connections with Newport.</p><p>An all-University Convocation at Meehan Auditorium opened the academic year on September 21 with an address by President Keeney.

The popular event, which became the first of the annual Commencement Pops Concerts, was held on the Pembroke campus.
