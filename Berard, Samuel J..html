<p>Samuel John <b>Berard</b> (1875-1971), professor of engineering, was born in 1875. Forced to leave school after sixth grade, Berard took jobs cleaning and in factories, and became a blueprint boy for the Deane Steam Pump Company. He was nearly thirty when he entered Sheffield Scientific School at Yale. He graduated with a bachelor of philosophy degree in 1908, and earned a Mechanical Engineering degree in 1910. He came to Brown as assistant professor of drawing and machine design in 1921, and was promoted to associate professor of engineering drawing in 1929. He retired in 1945. On his retirement, President Wriston noted another of Berard’s interests as “sponsor and advisor of the Band, which owes its continued existence and success to his enthusiasm and ability.” He died in Florida on November 21, 1971.</p>
