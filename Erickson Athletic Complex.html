<p>The <b>Erickson Athletic Complex</b> is the name given in 1988 to the former Aldrich-Dexter Field on Hope Street in honor of Wendell R. Erickson â€™19, a catcher on the baseball team, whose six million dollar bequest to the University would be used in part for the maintenance of athletic facilities. Four structures together with the playing fields make up the athletic complex: Meehan Auditorium, the ice rink built in 1961, Smith Swimming Center, built in 1973, Olney-Margolies Athletic Center, built in 1981, and Pizzitola Sports Center, completed in 1989. Aldrich Field is used for baseball, the Dexter Fields for intramurals, and Stevenson Field for soccer.</p>
