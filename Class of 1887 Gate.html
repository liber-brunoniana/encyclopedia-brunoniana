<p>The <b>Class of 1887 Gate</b> was designed by Hoppin and Ely and built by Norcross Brothers on Waterman Street in 1903. The verse beside the gate was written by Theodore Francis Green 1887.</p><blockquote>Welcome, O undergraduate,<br/>Within this ’87 gate!<br/>All entering here find hope endures,<br/>The fount of knowledge still allures,<br/>And here good fellowship abides<br/>To cheer and help whate’er betides.</blockquote>Line 3 of the verse is a paraphrase of Dante’s <i>Hell,</i> Canto III, Line 9, “All hope abandon, ye who enter here.” It also applies to “Hope” College at the right inside the gate. The “fount” in line 4 is the college pump in back of Hope College, and the home of “good fellowship” is the Brown Union at the left inside the gate.
