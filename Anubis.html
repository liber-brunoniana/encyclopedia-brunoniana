<p><b><i>Anubis</i></b> was a four-page newspaper selling for five cents which appeared unnumbered sometime during the academic year 1985-86. Named for the figure in Egyptian mythology who ushered the dead to their judgment, it attempted in its articles “to analyse a situation from a given perspective without trying to limit, deceive or confuse the reader.”</p>
