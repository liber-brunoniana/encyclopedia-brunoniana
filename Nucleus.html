<p><b><i>Nucleus,</i></b> “a little magazine,” was first published in the winter of 1953. Edited by Abbott Jay Reeves ’54, the magazine solicited manuscripts and drawings from the world at large, and included the work of David Cornel DeJong and Maurice Dolbier, as well as that of Professors Bloom, Blistein, and Philbrick. Only three issues were printed, the last in the winter of 1954. On the back covers of all of them was the quotation of George Santayana, “I am a very ignorant man; almost a poet.”</p>
